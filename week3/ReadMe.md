# Homework-3 Coding a Password-Generator Using Java Script

## For my Homework 3 - The following was done:

 - Created Multiple Variables so their easily called upon whilst using functions.
 - Created Arrays for Special Characters, Numbers, Lower Case & Upper Case Letters (These would the password outcome).
 - Added an Event Listener for the submit button, for when it was clicked.
 - Added a function to generate the password which included prompts, this allowed booleans (True or False) to be used, and messages  (questions) to the user.
 - The function included a number of if's and else if's, to determine the out come of the password.
 - A for loop was used to to allow random selections from the arrays to generate the password, so math.random and math.floor was also used in this.
 - A function to put the password generated into the textbox.


## How To Use - User Instructions:

1. Firtly the user will click the generate password button.
2. The user will then be prompted - 'Password Length - Choose Between 8 & 128'
2. If entered incorrectly the user will be given a message - 'Value MUST be Between 8 and 128'.
4. If entered incorrectly for the second time, user will be given a message 'Please Follow Instructions!', and it will close the pop up and user will need to start again.
5. When a number between 8 & 128 is entered, the user will then recieve options of whether the password requires: Special Characters, Numbers, Upper or Lowercase Letters.
6. Atleast 1 must be selected other wise it will show - 'Please Follow Instructions!' and pop up will close and you will have to start again.
7. When a minimum of one is selected it will then produce your password inside the textbox area.
