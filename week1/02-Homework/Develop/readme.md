# What did i do?

# For my Homework/assignment i did the folowing:

# HTML
- to ensure all the navigational links are working, 
	i realised one of the navigational links was not working, an 'id' class was missing on one of the naviagation codes in the html file, 
	once i had added the missing 'id' it began to work perfectly directing me to the correct place.
- i had to add semantic elements to the html coding to make it easier to undertand and easier to lay out. 
	i repalced the 'divs' with a number of semantic elements such as 'section', 'header', 'footer', 'aside', 'nav', 'menu' and 'main'.
- the orginal footer 'h2' tag was replaced with a 'h4' tag
	this was done to show it was not as importany as the 'h1', 'h2' and 'h3' tags
- added alt atributes were added to the images
	this is added incase the images dont load sue to internet issues etc
- img tage was added as well as the source
	this was becuase the image was not loading when adding a 'alt atribute', so i then added a complete tag '<img class="hero" src="" alt=""/> for it to work.
- meta title was changed 
	i used an optical format to give it a descriptive title.

# CSS
- family font 'Calibri' was not working
	i added the apostrophes to 'Calibri' in all the texts for 'menu', 'main' and 'aside' for it to work.
- divs to semantic elements
	the 'divs' tags that were changed in the html document were also changed in the css documant for the styling to match and work on the web page.
- footer 'h2' tag to 'h4'
	this was also changed to match the html document for the styling to work on the webpage.
- Headings tags
	the styling for the three 'h2' headings in the main content were styled seperatly, i combined the styling into one.
	the styling forthe three 'h3' headings in the aside content were styled seperatly, i combined the styling into one.
- text 
	the styling for the text in the main content were styled seperatly, i combined the styling into one.
	the styling for the text in the aside content were styled seperatly, i combined the styling into one.
- images on webpage
	the styling for images in the main contect were styled seperatly, i combined them into one.
