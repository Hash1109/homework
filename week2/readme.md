# What did i do?

## For my Homework/assignment i did the following:

## HTML
- I created 3 html pages: index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html
- I used links from the bootstrap site to develop the pages ans linked the bootstrap cdn to my pages, therefore its css would work and images would be responsive.
- I created two headers and nav bars, used semantic elements, used bootstrap's grid system (containers,rows and coloums).
- All html pages were validated using a html validator.
  
## CSS
- - I also created an additional css page to further style my pages and create media queries to ensure the pages are responsive on any device.
- class's and id's etc were created and linked into the css page to target elements to stlye. 

## Images
- Images of css coding, html pages and responsive pages - folder in homework (snapshots)
